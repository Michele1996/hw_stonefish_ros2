### stonefish_ros2 package for ROS2

This package delivers a ROS2 interface for the _Stonefish_ library. It also includes a standard simulator node, which loads the simulation scenario from a scenario description file (XML). The included parser extends the standard functionality of the _Stonefish_ library to enable search for files, resolution of parameters as well as a complete message interface. 

### Installation

1. Install the open-source [Stonefish](https://github.com/patrykcieslak/stonefish) library (*the same version as the ROS2 package!*).
2. Clone the *stonefish_ros2* package to your workspace.
3. Compile the workspace.

### Launching

To run the standard simulator node you have to include the 'stonefish_simulator.launch.py' file in your own launch file, overriding the default arguments.
Please refer to the documentation for details.
